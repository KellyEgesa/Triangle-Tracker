# TRIANGLE TRACKING
#### Helps a user to know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all, Friday 15th February 2019
#### By **Bartholomew Kelly Egesa**
## Description
For a triangle to be equilateral all sides of the triangle should be equal,For a triangle to be isosceles two sides of the triangle should be equal,For a triangle to be scalene all sides of the triangle should be equal. A user inputs the values of the sides of the triangle and the program calculates the type of the triangle. In the event that the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values thus the program returns an output that says not a triangle.
